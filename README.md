ANN Handwriting Recognition
===================================

Handwriting Digit Recognition is most popular problem
to the area of machine learning in AI

Introduction
------------

For this project, the goal is to complete electronic conversion
of images, hand written or printed text by over thousands unique authors, into machine-encoded
text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document or from subtitle text superimposed
on an image.
Depended on the scope of the field, it will be only considered a subset of characters, digits 0 to 9
in this project. This narrowed down domain can be applied to the identification of US postal codes,
bank check identification processing, and any task that follows numeric data processing. In order
to get formally state the problem domain, AI project will be a handwriting recognition program
specifically targeting digits zero to nine, on top of a machine learning algorithm accomplished by
artificial neural networks.
